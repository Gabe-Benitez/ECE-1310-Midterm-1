// G_Benitez_New_Midterm1.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//Programmer: Gabriel Benitez
//Program: Exponential Summation of Talyor Series up to 9 terms. e^x = Summation ((n^x)/x!)
//Description: e^x = Summation ((n^x)/x!) where n is the number the user enters. x is the number of terms, which will be from 0 to 10
//			   Entering a negative number ENDS the program
